## **My Personal Archive**

__This repo contains all my personal files during the learning process :)__

__List of my Branch :)__
- __Bootcamp__ - All courses I have studied online.
- __CheatSheet__ - Cheatsheet for Github, Git and Terminal
- __Images__ - Image collections for desktop backgrounds
- __projects__ - Personal projects like calculator, to-do list, web pages, etc.
- __textFiles__ - For my google drive folders
- __WordPress__ - For my WordPress testing on my local machine

__Please NOTE :)__ This repo is not useful to you! one of the reasons I created this is to easily go back in the future if I am on a different computer.

I did not create a new repo for each of my projects to minimize my repo counts and to avoid stress!.
