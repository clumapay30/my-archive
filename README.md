# My Personal Archive

__This repo contains all my personal copies on different branch:)__

- __Bootcamp__ - All courses I have studied online.
- __CheatSheet__ - Cheatsheet for Github, Git and Terminal
- __Images__ - Image collections for desktop backgrounds
- __projects__ - Personal projects like calculator, to-do list, web pages, etc.
- __textFiles__ - For my google drive folders
- __WordPress__ - For my WordPress testing on my local machine

__Please NOTE :)__ This repo is not useful to you. One of the reasons I created this is to easily go back in the future if I am on a different computer.

I did not create a new repo for each of my projects to minimize my repo counts.
